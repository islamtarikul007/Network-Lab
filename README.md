# Network-Lab
This project demonstrates a complete enterprise network configuration between a Head Office (Dhaka) and a Branch Office (Chittagong). The setup includes VLANs, DHCP, OSPF routing, inter-VLAN communication, SSH configuration, and switch port security.

Project: Head-Office & Branch-Office Network Lab Configuration


ðŸ”¹ Key Features:

DHCP Server Configuration (Dynamic IP allocation for VLANs)

Multiple VLAN Setup (VLAN 10, 20, 30, 40 for different departments)

Inter-VLAN Routing with ip helper-address

OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) for dynamic routing between HO & BR

Switch Port Security (MAC binding, violation shutdown, sticky MAC)

SSH Remote Access with domain name & authentication

Core & Access Switch Configurations for structured enterprise design

ðŸ”¹ Technologies Used:

Cisco Packet Tracer / GNS3

Cisco Routers & Switches (Layer 2 & 3)

Protocols: DHCP, OSPF, VLAN, SSH

ðŸ”¹ Skills Demonstrated:

Enterprise LAN/WAN Design

VLAN Segmentation & Security

Routing Protocol Implementation

Network Troubleshooting & Simulation
